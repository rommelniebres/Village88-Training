    <h1>Ninja</h1>
    <p>A ninja (忍者, Japanese pronunciation: [ɲiꜜɲdʑa]) or shinobi (忍び, [ɕinobi]) was a covert agent or mercenary in
        feudal Japan. The functions of a ninja included espionage, deception, and surprise attacks.[1] Their covert
        methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai.[2] Though
        shinobi proper, as specially trained spies and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku
        period,[3] antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century.[4][5]

        In the unrest of the Sengoku period, mercenaries and spies for hire became active in Iga Province and the
        adjacent area around the village of Kōga, and it is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the
        ninja is drawn. Following the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, the ninja
        faded into obscurity.[6] A number of shinobi manuals, often based on Chinese military philosophy, were written
        in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the Bansenshukai (1676).[7]

        By the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in
        Japan. Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities
        such as invisibility, walking on water and control over natural elements. As a consequence, their perception in
        popular culture is based more on such legends and folklore than on the covert actors of the Sengoku period.</p>
