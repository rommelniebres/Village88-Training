				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
				<p>
					JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
					language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of
					reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing
					maximum flexibility for developers to lake it in a bunch of
					different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
					environment (a web browser or Node saver), it can he
					connected to the objects of these environment to provide
					programmatic control over them.

				<ul>
					<li>
						<span>Variable Declaration</span>
						JavaScript variables are containers for storing data
						values - imagine a cup you fill with, the cup holds the
						coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript
						variables must be identified with a unique names. These
						unique names are called identifiers.
						<span class="violet">var x;</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Variable Assignment</span>
						Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript
						variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
						giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment
						operator assigns a value to a variable.
						<span class="violet">var x = 10;</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Data Types</span> Data Types are an important
						concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to
						know the data type. There are six data types that are
						JavaScript primitives: Boolean -
						<span class="violet">true</span> or
						<span class="violet">false;</span> null -
						<span class="violet">null</span> aka nothing; Number -
						<span class="violet">42</span> or
						<span class="violet">3.14159;</span> String -
						<span class="violet">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array-
						<span class="violet">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span>
						and Object -
						<span class="violet"
							>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want
						to perform different actions for different decisions -
						hitting different code blocks based on values or
						conditions that have been met. You can use conditional
						statements in your code to accomplish this. There are
						the following conditional statements:
						<span class="violet">if</span>
						a specified condition is true, do this code in our code
						block;
						<span class="violet">else if</span> to specify a new
						condition to test, if the first condition is false;
						<span class="violet">else</span>
						we execute this block of code;
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Loops</span>
						There are many different kinds of loops in every
						programming language, but they all essentially do the
						same thing: they will repeat an action some number of
						times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run
						around the track four times and then you stop. mats a
						loop!
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Function </span>
						Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we
						call our function this will run that code block. Think
						of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine
						we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the
						instruction manual and get started, first we screw the
						legs to the table top; next we place the table the right
						way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there
						are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function
						over and over and over again.
